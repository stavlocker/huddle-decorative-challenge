# frontendmentor.io challenge - Huddle landing page

This is my take on [frontendmentor.io](http://frontendmentor.io)'s [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-596348), Huddle landing page with coded decorative elements.

It was written in HTML and CSS (no precompiler. Why? I was lazy).

Enjoy. [View it here!](https://stavlocker.github.io/huddle-decorative-challenge/)
