# frontendmentor.io challenge - Huddle landing page

This is my take on [frontendmentor.io](http://frontendmentor.io)'s [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-596348), Huddle landing page with coded decorative elements.

It was written in HTML and CSS (no precompiler. Why? I was lazy).

Enjoy. [View it here!](https://stavlocker.github.io/huddle-decorative-challenge/)

## How I did things

These are my solutions to some more obvious problems I encountered. Of course you can just look at the source code. But, if you're doing this challenge on your own, do notice that these are SPOILERS! Click on a heading to view my solution.

  <summary><b>The white Huddle logo with no extra assets</b></summary><blockquote>
  I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter">filters</a> to turn the image grayscale, and then boosted the brightness to 1000% so everything was white.

  ```css
  filter: grayscale(100%) brightness(1000%);
  ```

  <summary><b>The decorative background elements</b></summary><blockquote>
  This one was pretty difficult, and also isn't easy to explain. So here's a <a href="https://github.com/stavlocker/huddle-decorative-challenge/blob/bc55aae08519a6be556c1826ddd111d9e042a583/style.css#L51">link</a> to the source code where I coded it.
